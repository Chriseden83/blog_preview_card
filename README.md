- Mobile first approach

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After 2/3 years away from web development I decided very recently to get back into the hotseat and give it another go after being dealt with a few life changing blows. This is my first challenge back so stayed away from CSS pre processors to re-learn things I used to know.

To push myself a little more I added some animations and transitions including a few hover states to try and make it stand out.

### Continued development

Going forward I'd like to relearn CSS grid, use a CSS pre processor like Sass along with javascript to eventually jump back into framework / libraries such as React, Next.JS, typescript.
